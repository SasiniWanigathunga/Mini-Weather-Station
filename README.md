# WeatherWise - Mini Weather Station
Welcome to WeatherWise, a mini weather station project created by me as part of a university endeavor in the field of electronics and sensors.
## Overview
WeatherWise is a smart and connected weather station designed to measure temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and ambient light intensity. It provides real-time weather data that can be accessed through a web dashboard and a mobile application.
## Key Features
1. Accurate and Reliable Measurements: WeatherWise is equipped with high-quality sensors (BMP280, HTU21D, and LDR) that deliver precise and reliable weather data.
2. WiFi Connectivity: The weather station connects to the Blynk IoT platform via WiFi, allowing users to monitor weather data from anywhere using a web dashboard or mobile app.
3. Power Optimization: WeatherWise employs power-saving techniques to maximize battery life, including data transmission at specific intervals and reduced current consumption.
4. Buzzer Alert: The integrated buzzer provides alerts during extreme weather conditions, ensuring users stay informed about significant weather changes.
